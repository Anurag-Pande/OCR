# OCR
This OCR is built using supervised learning algorithm and also done by using keras neural nets.
###The char A-F file is the dataset of images that have been used in the project.
## What is supervised learning?
### Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

## What is keras?
### Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.
